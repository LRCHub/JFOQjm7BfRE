South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture, in old Spanish lace
And just for a while I kissed the smile upon her face
It was a fiesta, and we were so gay
South of the border
Down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana
For tomorrow never came

South of the border, I came back one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light she knelt to pray
The Mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border
Down Mexico way.
