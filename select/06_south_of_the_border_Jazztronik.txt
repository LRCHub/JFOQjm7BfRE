see there was a girl called nika, from down nagasaki way
she ran off with a catford boy, rico and they were soon on
their way

to mitcham or someplace way down south
where they wear wide hat and thick moustache

she played double bass and drank strong coffee
he had a dog tyson and fed it banofee

she felt like an outlaw - and lived with a smile
he was an outlaw lived with a pile
of cash on the dresser
allways left a messer
in the sink, where he shaped his beard
look like che in the mirror, tho a little more weird

had a scooter not a bike but equally feard

was late summer 2003
night was hot and a little breezy

she just reech, he was doing a deal
south of the river with a nite to steal

ch... oh uh south of the border
oh uh south of the water

oh, heh
oh heh
tell you about a man name jazztronik
esh ya so call him gin and tonic
locking the bass freeing up the sonic
infect a rhythm faster than bubonic

in a bar called acapolco
by the river where to a pull a you would go
rico told niko they'd run off down south
kenny of camden opend his mouth
said
niko don't go south of the border
unless your following order
don't go off to the badlands
where time is lost in the sinking sands
some of them still drive cortina
and wear string vest called a marina
all have friends called marcia and tina
for a visit not a life if ya know what i meana

ch...

but now it's summer 2005
niko and rico still there and alive
he still sells, she still plays
their way down south but he changed his ways
he cooks soba meals for tea
and now their 2 more mouths to feed
thats the story of niko and rico
way down south now with nego and kiko

way down south
way down south
way down south
way down south of the border
