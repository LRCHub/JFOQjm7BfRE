South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as I wander my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was the fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered, "Mañana
" Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered, "Mañana," for our tomorrow never came
South of the border, I wrote back one day
There is a veil of white, by candlelight she knelt to pray
The mission bells tolled me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
