Ai-ai-ai-ai
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ai-ai-ai-ai
Oh-oh-oh-oh

South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love, when stars above came out to play
And now as I wonder, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was fiesta, and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whisperd manana, for our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight, she kneeled to pray
The missionbells told me that I musn't stay
South of the border, down mexico way

Ai-ai-ai-ai
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ai-ai-ai-ai
Oh-oh-oh-oh-
